# Tool Name

React component generator

## Previous Workflow

Previously, developers were required to manually write boilerplate code for each new component in a React application. This included creating a new file, importing the necessary modules, writing a functional or class-based component, and then exporting that component. If we estimate that each component took roughly 15 minutes to set up, in a medium to large-scale project with around 100 components, that's approximately 25 hours spent solely on boilerplate code.

## Solution Description

The React Component Generator tool streamlines the process of creating new components in a React application. By simply providing the name of the component, the tool automatically generates the boilerplate code required for a new functional or class-based component. It includes all necessary imports and a basic component structure. This significantly reduces the time spent on setting up new components, allowing developers to focus more on implementing the actual functionality and less on the repetitive setup tasks.
